;;; Commentary:

;; Docker mode is a mode for controlling docker from within Emacs.
;; I was looking for a magit like interface and decided that I should
;; create it myself since I didn't find anything I liked.

;; ## Basic Usage

;; Start with

;;     (require 'docker-mode)

;; ## docker images

;; Command: M-x docker-images RET

;; Show all images that docker knows about

;; ## docker ps

;; Command: M-x docker-ps RET

;; Show all running docker containers.


;;; Code:

(require 'docker-images)

(provide 'docker-mode)

;;; docker-mode.el ends here
